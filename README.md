# Sustainability Analysis of Commercial Building Energy Consumption in the United States

## Project Oveview 
This project aims to leverage machine learning methodologies to uncover the underlying factors influencing energy consumption in commercial buildings across the United States. Our primary objective is to predict total energy usage based on a range of building characteristics. By doing so, we seek to identify key attributes of commercial buildings that merit particular attention, with the ultimate goal of fostering sustainability and energy efficiency.

The dataset utilized in this project is the 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) Data, sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This publicly available dataset encompasses information on diverse building features and energy consumption metrics across 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. With a sample size of 6,436 buildings and approximately 1200 features, the dataset offers comprehensive insights into various aspects of commercial buildings, including size, occupancy, construction materials, equipment, and energy usage patterns. The target variable for our analysis is total energy consumption.
